# vnv

VNV is an accronym for Verleihen, Dienstleistungen, Verschenken (lending,  services, comping).
VNV will be a web portal, where you can connect with your friends to borrow items from them, give things you donâ€™t use anymore to a friend looking for exact that one or you can check if one of your mates can help you with a problem (e.g. if you need help with your network).
